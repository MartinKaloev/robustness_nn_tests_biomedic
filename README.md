# robustness_nn_tests_biomedic
this repository is used for biomedic conference testing robustness in neural networks




#to do:
1) create simple nn[neural network] for classification (optionaly type for regresion) 
2) create robust improvet version of the simple nn with extra ports in the input layer
3) chose real life data sets for testing nn 
4) check the results and acknologe how more input ports improve the robustness
5) upload data results in csv

##end task list
